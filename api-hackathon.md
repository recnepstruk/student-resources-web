#API Hackathon!

**Explore third-party APIs** and extend your skillset by making something super cool in a short period of time. You will attempt to integrate (consume) a third-party API and build a tiny single page App demonstrating as much as you can using what you have learned thus far in this course!

You'll be competing for the `Coolest Project Award` (there might be a **<em>prize</em>**...) which will be awarded to the team that builds the most useful, interesting, or fun App utilizing third-party APIs.

#### Groups
You will work in groups of 3 for this hack party. Don't forget to establish a good team workflow at the beginning!
